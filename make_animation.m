function make_animation(t, x, y, th, ast_x, ast_y, ast_th, ast_dx, ast_dy, fps)
% warning: this is a crude animation - don't take it too seriously!
%
% It expects t, x, y, etc as regular arrays (pass as x.signals.values)
% and a constant step size, which is likely what you want when doing
% control
%
% fps is the number of frames per second the animation should run at
%
% There are two timings happening here: one to make the animation run in
% roughly real time, and one to set the number of frames shown per second
% The path that the asteroid would take in the absence of gravity or drag
% forces is shown, mainly to make you aware of the fact that predicting
% the asteroid's path is not trivial
%
% Lastly, there is a small line to help you keep track of the asteroid's
% angle
